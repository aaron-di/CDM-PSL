## Abstract

**CDM-PSL (Composite Diffusion Model-Based Pareto Set Learning)** is a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges of expensive multi-objective Bayesian optimization (EMOBO). While MOBO has shown great potential in solving expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs), it struggles to model complex distributions of the Pareto optimal solutions when only a limited number of function evaluations are available.

Existing Pareto set learning methods often exhibit instability in expensive scenarios, leading to significant deviations between the obtained solution set and the true Pareto set (PS). To overcome these challenges, CDM-PSL introduces **Composite Diffusion Model** to enhance optimization performance.
